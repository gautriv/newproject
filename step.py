Team, I'm thrilled to share that I've been invited as an "expert guest speaker" (yes, they said it, not me!) to speak on the riveting topic of "The Changing Dynamics of Technical Writing" on September 25. And guess what? It’s organized by none other than Document360! So, if you’re looking for some dynamic changes, or just curious to see if I can pronounce "dynamics" correctly under pressure, stay tuned!
